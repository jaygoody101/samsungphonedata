Codebook for Samsung Phone Dataset 


subject
Factor: [1,...,30]
identifier for subject in study

activity
Factor: ["walking", "walkingupstairs","walkingdownstairs","sitting","standing","laying"]
identifies activity while data were being collected

direction
Factor: ['xdirection", "ydirection", "zdirection", "magnitude"]
identify the axial direction of the signal (x,y,z); and the Euclidean norm magnitude calculated from those signals

The signals are average means and average standard deviations for each combination of subject, activity, and direction

Each original individual data stream was a times series collected either by an accelomerator or gyroscope in a given direction.

These were further separated into "Body" and "Gravity" signals as described below.

The first part of each variable name "freq" or "time" indicates whether the data were analyzed in the frequency or time domains.

The second part indicates whethet it is Body or Gravity signal.

The third part indicates whether it was measured with the accelerometer or gyrosope

An auxiliary signal was used to obtain a "jerk" signal as described below; if "jerk" is present in the name then the column will contain this derived variable.

The last part of the name indicates whether the "mean" signal or "standard deviation" signal was considered.

When an original variable name contains "XYZ", it was actually represented by three separate variables, with and X, Y, or a Z indicated, respectively.

The 18 variables were all normalized to be in the range [-1,1] prior to determination of summaary statistics.

The new and original variables are:

freqbodyaccelerometermean and freqbodyaccelerometerstdev
(based on original variables fBodyAcc-XYZ and fBodyAccMag)

freqbodyaccelerometerjerkmean and freqbodyaccelerometerjerkstdev
(based on original variables fBodyAccJerk-XYZ and fBodyAccJerkMag)

freqbodygyroscopejerkmean and freqbodygyroscopejerkstdev
(based on original variable fBodyGyroJerkMag for which directional data were not provided)

freqbodygyroscopemean and freqbodygyroscopestdev
(based on original variables fBodyGyro-XYZ and fBodyGyroMag)

timebodyaccelerometermean and timebodyaccelerometerstdev
(based on original variables tBodyAcc-XYZ and tBodyAccMag)

timebodyaccelerometerjerkmean and timebodyaccelerometerjerkstdev
(based on original variables tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyAccJerkMag)

timebodygyroscopejerkmean and timebodygyroscopejerkstdev
(based on original variables tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerkMag)

timebodygyroscopemean and timebodygyroscopestdev
(based on original variables tBodyGyro-XYZ and tBodyGyroMag)

timegravityaccelerometermean and timegravityaccelerometerstdev
(based on original variables tGravityAcc-XYZ tGravityAccMag)





From "Original Description" of this dataset


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
